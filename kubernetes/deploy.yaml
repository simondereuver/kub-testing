#
# -This YAML  manifest file contains two kubernetes resources for the video-streaming microservice.
#  - One Deployment, and one Service for the Deployment's Pods.
#  - Notice how multiple resources can be defined in one YAML file by separating them with 3 dashes ---
# 
# Note!
# The placeholders below have to be replaced before deploying the manifest to kubernetes:
#   $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER
#   $VERSION
#
# This can be done by creating environment variables in Linux as below:
#   export CONTAINER_REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER=<your-container-registry>
#   export VERSION=<the-version-to-deploy>
#
# Then replace the placeholders and deploy the manifest using the Linux command below:
#   envsubst < ./scripts/kubernetes/deploy.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
#
